FFGLCIFilters are OSX 10.4+ CoreImage filters wrapped as FreeFrameGL filters.


Building and installing instructions
------------------------------------

FFGLCIFilters require scons and glew. They were developed with
MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/).

To build, go to the ffglcifilters folder and type:
scons

To build bundles instead of dylibs type:

FFGLCIFilters were developed for Fluxus (http://www.pawfal.org/fluxus), although
they can be used in any FFGL capable applications.

sudo scons install

To install to a specific folder type:
sudo scons --bundle install InstallDir=/Applications/Resolume\ Avenue\ 3.1.3/plugins/vfx/
